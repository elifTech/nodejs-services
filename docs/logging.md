# Logging

Universal logging library [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) is used for logging. It has support for multiple transports.  A transport is essentially a storage device for your logs. Each instance of a winston logger can have multiple transports configured at different levels. For example, one may want error logs to be stored in a persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file. We just log to the console for simplicity, you can configure more transports as per your requirement.
